# Week 1: Course Introduction & Data Governance Fundamentals

## Overview

This is the first week of GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data. The week focuses on introducing students to participatory policy analysis in Hong Kong, with particular emphasis on data governance and citizen advocacy. Students will explore real-world examples and learn about mathematical approaches to policy problems.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the course structure and assessment requirements
- Explore the role of data in Hong Kong public policy making
- Examine data governance practices and transparency issues
- Identify opportunities for mathematical modeling in policy analysis
- Connect course content to UN SDGs, particularly SDG 11
- Prepare for AI-assisted research methodologies



## Content Structure

Week 1 is divided into multiple modules, each containing lecture notes, interactive MC tasks for comprehension checking, optional open-ended tasks, and reflection/note-taking activities.

### Module 1: Interactive Lecture - The St Martin Bus Stop Case

**Topic**: Data Governance in Action - How Citizens Can Drive Change

**Lecture Notes**:

- Introduction to the St Martin bus stop problem: duplicate naming in mobile apps leading to passenger confusion
- The problem: Both north and south stops appear as "St Martin" without unique identifiers
- Real-world impact: Daily commuter frustration, potential safety concerns

**Interactive MC Tasks**:

1. What type of problem is this?
   - A) Technology problem - apps need better GPS
   - B) Data governance problem - inconsistent naming standards ✓
   - C) User experience problem - people need better training
   - D) Business problem - bus companies need better coordination

**Optional Open-ended Tasks**:

- Research similar data quality issues in Hong Kong public services
- Map out the user journey for someone trying to catch a bus at St Martin

**Reflection & Note-taking**:

- Journal entry: Personal experiences with confusing data or services
- Note key stakeholders involved in public transportation data management

### Module 2: Citizen Advocacy Journey

**Topic**: Dr. Simon Wang's Advocacy Journey - From Problem to Solution

**Lecture Notes**:

- Step-by-step timeline of citizen advocacy process
- Problem recognition: Personal experience leads to systematic investigation
- Initial contact: Polite but ineffective response from Transport Department
- Strategic escalation: Reaching Assistant Director with business case
- Solution implementation: Unique identifiers added to distinguish stops

**Interactive MC Tasks**:

1. What made the escalation successful?
   - A) Using more emotional language
   - B) Reaching decision-maker with clear business case ✓
   - C) Threatening to go public
   - D) Including multiple government departments

**Optional Open-ended Tasks**:

- Analyze the email communication strategy differences
- Identify potential escalation paths for different types of public issues

**Reflection & Note-taking**:

- Personal action plan: How to approach local government with concerns
- Note effective communication strategies for policy advocacy

### Module 3: Data Governance & Mathematical Analysis

**Topic**: From Individual Problems to Systematic Analysis

**Lecture Notes**:

- Data quality principles violated: Uniqueness, Usability, Consistency
- Mathematical analysis opportunities:
  - Statistical analysis: Error rates, user confusion metrics
  - Machine learning: Duplicate detection algorithms
  - Optimization: Naming convention design
- API programming demonstration: Finding duplicate bus stop names programmatically

**Interactive MC Tasks**:

- Analysis of mathematical applications in data governance
- Understanding optimization problems in naming conventions

**Optional Open-ended Tasks**:

- Design a mathematical model for optimal bus stop naming
- Analyze cost-benefit of data quality improvements

**Reflection & Note-taking**:

- Personal insights on how math can solve real-world policy problems
- Connection to UN SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)

### Module 4: Practice & Discussion Activities

**Topic**: Writing & Discussion Activities for Deeper Learning

**Interactive Tasks**:

1. Personal Experience Reflection

   - Write about a service/system problem experience
   - Share with peers for discussion
   - Get AI feedback on reflection quality
2. Action Strategy Development

   - Design ideal action plan for addressing service problems
   - Compare strategies with classmates
   - Receive AI suggestions for strategy improvement
3. Professional Communication

   - Write professional email/letter to authorities
   - Get peer review and AI feedback
   - Focus on clarity, evidence, constructive tone
4. Key Insights & Takeaways

   - Reflect on learning outcomes from advocacy process
   - Share insights with peers
   - Get AI guidance for deeper reflection

**Reflection & Note-taking**:

- Synthesis of learning across all activities
- Personal growth in citizen advocacy confidence
- Future applications of learned skills

### Module 5: Reflection & Assessment

**Topic**: Report & Reflection - Consolidating Learning

**Activities**:

- Submit generated reports via Moodle
- Receive teacher feedback
- Self-assessment of course expectations
- Journaling exercises for personal development

## Assessment Integration

- **Individual Work (50%)**: In-class exercises, reflective essays, human-AI collaboration report
- **Group Work (50%)**: Presentations and final project report
- Week 1 activities connect to: Reflective Essay 1 (personal experience analysis)

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Each module includes progress tracking and interactive elements
- AI integration for personalized feedback and guidance
- Peer discussion prompts and structured collaboration
- Comprehensive reporting for teacher evaluation

## Connection to Course Goals

- Demonstrates how individual citizen action drives systematic improvements
- Establishes foundation for mathematical analysis in public policy
- Prepares students for collaborative, AI-assisted research methodologies
- Connects to UN SDGs through real-world policy impact examples
